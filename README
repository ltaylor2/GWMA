# ----------------------------------

This program allows for automated motion detection of GWMA on their lekking logs.
The vision analysis is built using OpenCV for Python.

Program process:
	1. Read-in a single video file and determine a stationary "background" from the FIRST VIDEO FRAME.
	2. Resize input, convert to grayscale, and blur.
	3. Determine pixel differences from background frame and determine which frames have motion.
	4. Calculate motion periods, including a buffer to avoid false positive starts and false negative stops.
	5. Output video clips (currently as .AVI) as detection finishes.
		Output filenames are formatted as: INPUTFILENAME_STARTSEC_ENDSEC
	6. Output relevant motion period data.

Running the program:
	This program was built on Ubuntu 14.04 in Python 2.7.6 using OpenCV 2.4.
	Other versions may interfere with video I/O due to Codec problems.
	OpenCV is terrible with version differences, so watch out.
	
	1. In OSX or Ubuntu, open a terminal window.
	2. Navigate (cd) to the directory that contains the src/ folder.
	3. Compile and run the program with the commands:
		python src/motionDetection.py [-h][-w] inFile [-o{outFile}]
		
		[inFile] is required, and must be the file path to the input video

		[-o] is optional. If -o is included, you must include a DIRECTORY FOLDER for output.
		[-w] is optional. It shows the thresholded motion images as the program runs. Pretty neat.
		[-h] is optional, and displays parameter help without running the program.

	EXAMPLES:
	     A full test:
		python src/motionDetection.py -w Test_Footage/Male_Female_Brits.mp4 -o Test_Output/

	     Without image display:
	 	python src/motionDetection.py Test_Footage/Male_Female_Brits.mp4 -o Test_Output/

	     With image display but without output:
	 	python src/motionDetection.py -w Test_Footage/Male_Female_Brits.mp4
