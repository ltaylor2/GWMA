# ----------------------------------

This program allows for automated motion detection of GWMA on their display logs.
The vision analysis is built using OpenCV for Python.

Program process:
	1. Read-in a single video file.
		NOTE ffmpeg may print "Invalid UE golomb code" warnings
		while frames are being read in. This does not affect
		the program and, while annoying, should be ignored.
	2. Resize input frames, convert to grayscale, and blur.
	3. Determine motion via velocity across a window of three frames.
	4. Threshold and score motion to determine motion periods. Store clips.
	5. After a prompt, allow the user to survey motion clips, clearing those that
		do not feature a bird. The program should contain many false positives
		but (no guarantees) no false negatives.
	6. Output a final list of times (H:MM:SS.SS) at which motin begins.
		NOTE Due to calculations from frames->seconds, motion occuring
		at the end of the video may be marked up to ~10s early than the 
		motion actually occurs in the video. The clips displayed within
		the program will still be accurate.


Running the program:
	This program was built on Ubuntu 16.04 in Python 2.7.12 using OpenCV 3.3.0-dev.
	Other versions may interfere with video I/O due to Codec problems.
	OpenCV is terrible with version differences, so watch out.
	
	1. On a computer with OpenCV and Python2 installed, open a terminal window.
	2. Navigate (cd) to the directory that contains the src/ folder.
	3. Compile and run the program with the commands:
		python src/motionDetection.py [-h][-w] inFile
		
		[inFile] is required, and must be the file path to the input video

		[-w] is optional. Show the thresholded motion images as the program runs. Fun.
		[-h] is optional, and displays parameter help without running the program.

	EXAMPLES:
	   UNIX (e.g., OSX or Ubuntu) Example:
		python src/motionDetection.py -w Test_Footage/Male_Female_Brits.mp4

	   Windows Example:
		C:\Python2.7\python.exe C:\Users\Username\GWMA\src\motionDetection.py -w C:\Users\Username\GWMA\Test_Footage\Male_Female_Brits.mp4
